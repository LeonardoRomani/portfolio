      "As the lead developer, I built a logistics management application for the Mercabarna distribution hub, designed to handle the scheduling and tracking of goods using Toro forklifts. The backend was developed in Python and MySQL to manage large volumes of data, while the frontend used JavaScript and HTML for real-time tracking. A user-friendly interface was implemented with Java Swing to facilitate operational tasks for onsite workers. This system improved inventory control, delivery schedules, and transportation logistics across the Mercabarna complex.",
